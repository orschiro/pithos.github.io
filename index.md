title: A Native Pandora.com Client for Linux
---

Pithos is a native [Pandora Radio](http://pandora.com) client for Linux. It's much more lightweight
than the Pandora.com web client, and integrates with desktop features such as media
keys, notifications, and the sound menu.

## FAQ

### Why the name "Pithos"?

The original Pandora myth used the word ["pithos"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pithos), which was mistranslated to "box". Similarly, a flash applet is a mistranslation to the Linux platform. 
 
### What does Pithos mean for Pandora?

Out of concern for the the longevity of Pandora Media Inc., I would recommend subscribing to Pandora One, or at the very least, clicking ads on [pandora.com](http://pandora.com).
