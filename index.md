title: Pandora Radio Client
---

Pithos is a native [Pandora Radio](http://pandora.com) client for Linux. It's much more lightweight
than the Pandora.com web client, and integrates with desktop features such as media
keys, notifications, and the sound menu.

## News

**We are happy to announce the release of Pithos 1.0.0!** This is a huge
release for the project. There are many new features, including a redesigned
UI and icon. We hope you like it! Pithos 1.0.0 requires GTK 3.10+
(Ubuntu 14.04). The release will be available via RPMFusion shortly.
See below for installation instructions.

## FAQ

### Why the name "Pithos"?

The original Pandora myth used the word ["pithos"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pithos), which was mistranslated to "box";. Similarly, a flash applet is a mistranslation to the Linux platform.
