title: Pithos Broke
---

From time to time, Pandora makes an API change that breaks Pithos. As an
unofficial client, Pithos has no prior notice about these changes.

**2012-04-24** [(bug #988395)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pithos/+bug/988395)

Versions 0.3.16 and previous are broken by a Pandora update.

**Updated 2012-05-03**

Version 0.3.17 fixes this issue. If you installed from the PPA, update Pithos through Update
Manager. If you installed from the Ubuntu repositories or are using another
distribution, follow the [install instructions on the home page](index.html).
